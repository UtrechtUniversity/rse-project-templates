# Research Engineering project templates

Internal repository for developing RE-style templates.

## README template

The `README` template, to be used as a blueprint for RSE projects, can be found in the [README-template.md](README-template.md).

An example usage of this template can be found in the [RemindoAPI](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/remindo-api) repository.

## Cookiecutter Research Engineering project (programming language independent)

To quickly get up and running with a new science project, you can use the [cookiecutter template `good-enough-project`](good-enough-project) created by [Martine de Vos](https://github.com/MartineDeVos). Please refer to the [README](good-enough-project/README.md) of the `good-enough-project` template to learn how use it.

A cookiecutter project allows you to set up all starting folders and files for a specific type of project. This particular template is based on the [Reproducible Science Cookiecutter](https://github.com/mkrapp/cookiecutter-reproducible-science) template by [Mario Krapp](https://github.com/mkrapp) and [Barbara Vreede](https://github.com/bvreede/good-enough-project).
